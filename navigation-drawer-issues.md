# Issues: Dependency errors Implementing Navigation Drawer Components

The assignment to add navigation drawer components caused Dependency conflicts.
The problem centered around specific versions:


npm ERR! code ERESOLVE
npm ERR! ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm ERR!
npm ERR! While resolving: nucampsite@1.0.0
npm ERR! Found: react-native-safe-area-context@4.3.1

To resolve the issue, I deleted to package-lock.json file, then removed all decencies from the package.json file.  I then launched the app via Expo.
